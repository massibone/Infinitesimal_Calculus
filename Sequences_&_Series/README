In terms of mathematical notation, 
a sequence is typically represented by a list of numbers enclosed in brackets or parentheses, 
such as {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} or (a_n), while a series is typically represented by the summation symbol ∑, 
followed by the terms of the sequence, such as ∑n=1^5 n = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5.

Sequences and series are important concepts in many areas of mathematics, 
including limit,calculus, number theory, and analysis, and have a wide range of applications in science, engineering, and finance.
