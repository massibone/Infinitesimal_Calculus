In terms of mathematical notation, 
a sequence is typically represented by a list of numbers enclosed in brackets or parentheses, 
such as {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} or (a_n), while a series is typically represented by the summation symbol ∑, 
followed by the terms of the sequence, such as ∑n=1^5 n = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5.

Sequences and series are important concepts in many areas of mathematics, 
including limit,calculus, number theory, and analysis, and have a wide range of applications in science, engineering, and finance.


'''
we calculate an example financial rate. We start with a principal of $1,000, 
an interest rate of 5%, and a term of 3 years. We use the formula for compound interest to calculate the future value of the investment, 
and then subtract the original principal to find the interest earned. Finally, 
we divide the interest earned by the original principal to find the financial rate of return.
