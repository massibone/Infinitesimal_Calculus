Differential equations are mathematical equations that involve an unknown function and its derivatives. 
They describe relationships between the function and its rates of change.

A differential equation typically contains one or more derivatives of an unknown function. 
The goal is to find the function that satisfies the equation, given certain initial conditions or constraints.

Differential equations are used to model and study various phenomena in science, engineering, economics, and many other fields. 
They provide a powerful tool for describing how quantities change and evolve over time or space.

There are different types of differential equations, including ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs). 
ODEs involve a single independent variable, while PDEs involve multiple independent variables.

Solving a differential equation involves finding a function or a set of functions that satisfy the equation. 
This can be done analytically, using techniques such as separation of variables, integration, or series expansions. 
Alternatively, numerical methods can be used to approximate solutions.

Differential equations have a wide range of applications, 
from describing the motion of objects to modeling population growth, heat transfer, fluid dynamics, electrical circuits, 
quantum mechanics, and more. They are an essential tool for understanding and predicting the behavior of 
complex systems in various scientific and engineering disciplines.
