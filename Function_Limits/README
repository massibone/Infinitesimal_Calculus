Concepts of functions and limits

Sure! Here's a translation of my previous answer:

A continuous function is a mathematical function that maintains its continuity over a range of values in its domain. 
In other words, a function is continuous if there are no interruptions or jumps in its values when its argument (the independent variable) moves through the domain interval.

For example, consider the function f(x) = x^2. This function is continuous at all of its values of x, since there are no interruptions or jumps in its values when x moves through the domain interval.

On the other hand, consider the function g(x) = 1/x. This function is not continuous at x=0, since the value of g(x) becomes infinite as x approaches zero from either the right or the left.

In practice, an example of a continuous function might be the temperature inside a room during the day. 
The temperature may fluctuate slightly in response to factors like human activity or changes in sunlight,
but it will generally change gradually and continuously, without sudden jumps or interruptions.
