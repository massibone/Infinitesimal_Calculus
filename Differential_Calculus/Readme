Differential calculus is a branch of calculus that focuses on studying the properties and behavior of functions through the concept of derivatives. It deals with the analysis of rates of change, slopes of curves, and the calculation of instantaneous rates of change.

The fundamental concept in differential calculus is the derivative. The derivative of a function measures how the function changes as its input (usually denoted as x) changes. Geometrically, the derivative represents the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at a specific point.

The derivative of a function f(x) is denoted as f'(x) or dy/dx, and it represents the rate at which the function changes with respect to the input variable x. The derivative provides information about the steepness, concavity, and local behavior of a function.

Differential calculus also encompasses concepts such as the chain rule, which allows for the differentiation of composite functions, and optimization techniques, such as finding the maximum or minimum values of functions.

Overall, differential calculus is a powerful tool for analyzing and understanding how functions change and behave, enabling us to solve a wide range of problems in fields such as physics, engineering, economics, and more.
